# Exercise-Break-App

The idea of this app is to use the heartbeat sensor technology found in most smart watches to calculate and find the optimal time to take a break and either get a drink or use its GPS to find a place that could sell a sports drink. This way the user takes a break at the optimal time on their bike ride or run to take a break to steady their heart rate and rehydrate during the trip.
